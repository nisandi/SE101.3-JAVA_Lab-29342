1)Try to declare the variable with/without public static final keywords. 
Is there any difference between these two approaches? Why?

In an interface, variables are implicitly public, static, and final, whether you explicitly declare them that way or not. 
That means you don't have to use the public static final keywords explicitly. 
The variable 'x' inside the interface is already 'public, static, and final' by default.
So, there is no difference between declaring it with or without these keywords.

2)Declare the abstract method with/without abstract keyword. 
Is there any difference between these two approaches? Why?
When you declare a method inside an interface, 
it is implicitly 'abstract' , whether you use the abstract keyword or not. 
So, there is no difference between declaring it with or without the 'abstract' keyword.
